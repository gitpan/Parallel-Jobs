	* Jobs.pm: Bump version number to 0.03.

	* Jobs.pm: Bug fixes from Paul GABORIT <gaborit@enstimac.fr> --
	read output and close file handles from children who have already
	exited, to avoid running out of file descriptors or missing output
	when a child exits before we've had time to read its output.

	* Jobs.pm: Increase version number to 0.02.

	The documentation should say to call Parallel::Jobs functions as
	functions, not methods.

	Document that start_job and watch_jobs can be exported.

	Be resilient to the possibility of being called incorrectly as a
	method rather than a function.
